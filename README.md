## Publishing/Updating Types

Types are generated by: [Digital Collections API](https://github.com/nulib/dc-api-v2#dc-api-typescript-npm-package) and PR'd into the `main` branch when the API is versioned.
PR's are reviewed by [auto assigning team members](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team#about-auto-assignment),
from a team defined in the (`CODEOWNERS`)[./github/CODEOWNERS] file, using a round robin strategy.

The `staging` branch tracks changes to the private staging DC API for development purposes only.
